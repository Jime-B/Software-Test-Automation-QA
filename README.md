# Software-Test-Automation-QA
To ensure the functionality and security of the code, JUnit unit tests were implemented to check constraints such as contact ID length, phone number format, and null values. The Contact class enforces data validation by throwing IllegalArgumentException for invalid inputs, while the ContactService class maintains data integrity by preventing duplicate entries and unauthorized modifications. Encapsulation safeguards data, and boundary testing ensures the system handles extreme inputs properly. While these measures strengthen reliability, incorporating security testing like input sanitization and encryption would further enhance protection.
User needs were met by following the software requirements, testing the limits of the system to catch errors and allowing updates to only specific parts of a contact instead of requiring all details to be changed at once. The program follows an object-oriented design. To ensure modularity and maintainability the Contact class handles individual data and ContactService class manages interactions. Checking the data helps keep the system running smoothly and efficiently, but testing with real users and seeing how the system performs under heavy use would ensure it works well in different situations.
